        <h2>Drive London’s Future</h2>
        <p>Welcome to EcoDrive Hub! Step into the electric revolution sweeping across London, where Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are transforming how we move through this vibrant city of over 9 million people. At EcoDrive Hub, we’re here to guide you on a journey toward cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable driving. Whether you’re a daily commuter dodging the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) fees of £12.50 a day, a tech-savvy professional eyeing the latest EV innovations, or an eco-conscious Londoner eager to shrink your carbon footprint, this is your one-stop hub for all things electric on the road.
            London’s streets are buzzing with change. With the city’s ambitious net-zero target by 2030 and Transport for London (TfL) rolling out over 11,000 charging points—including rapid hubs in Camden, Croydon, and beyond—electric driving isn’t just a trend; it’s the future. But we know the shift can feel daunting. Range anxiety, charging confusion, and the sheer variety of options can leave even the keenest drivers hesitant. That’s where EcoDrive Hub comes in. We’re here to cut through the noise, offering clear, practical insights to help you embrace EVs and PHEVs with confidence. From saving on Congestion Charges to tapping into TfL’s growing network of chargers, we’ll show you how electric driving fits seamlessly into your London lifestyle.
            Our mission is simple yet bold: to empower every Londoner to make the switch to electric, one informed decision at a time. We’re not here to sell you a car or process payments—this isn’t about transactions. Instead, EcoDrive Hub is a platform built on education, inspiration, and community. Picture this: you’re zipping past Tower Bridge in a silent, zero-emission Nissan Leaf, or plugging in your Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid at a Westminster station, knowing you’re part of a cleaner, greener London. That’s the vision we’re driving toward, and we invite you to join us.

            <h2>Our Mission: Powering London’s Electric Future </h2>
            <p>At EcoDrive Hub, our mission is rooted in London’s unique challenges and opportunities. This city—home to iconic red buses, black cabs, and now a growing fleet of electric vehicles—faces a pressing need to tackle air pollution and congestion. The ULEZ, expanded in 2023 to cover all London boroughs, charges non-compliant vehicles £12.50 daily, while the Congestion Charge adds another £15 for peak-hour driving in central zones. For many, these costs are a daily burden, yet they signal a clear push toward sustainability. EVs and PHEVs offer a way out—zero road tax, exemptions from these fees, and a chance to breathe easier in a city long plagued by smog. Our goal is to make that transition accessible, understandable, and exciting for every Londoner.
                We believe knowledge is the key to change. Too often, potential EV adopters stumble over myths: “Batteries don’t last,” “Charging takes too long,” or “There’s nowhere to plug in.” EcoDrive Hub dismantles these barriers with facts. Did you know TfL has installed over 300 rapid chargers since 2020, capable of juicing up an EV in under 30 minutes? Or that EVs like the Tesla Model 3 can travel over 300 miles on a single charge, far exceeding the average London commute?</p>

        <div class="why">
            <h2>About EcoDrive Hub </h2>
            <p>Behind EcoDrive Hub is a fictional team passionate about London’s sustainable transformation. Founded in 2025 (for this assignment’s sake), our company emerged from a shared vision among a group of London-based advocates—environmentalists, tech enthusiasts, and urban planners—who saw EVs as more than a trend, but a necessity. While we’re not a real entity, imagine us headquartered at a fictional address: 123 Green Lane, London E1 4BX, just a stone’s throw from the eco-conscious vibe of Shoreditch. Our team, though imagined, includes voices like Emma Taylor, a former TfL planner who knows London’s transport grid inside out, and Raj Patel, a tech innovator obsessed with battery breakthroughs.
                Our company’s ethos is to serve, not sell. Unlike car dealerships or charging firms, we don’t push products or profit from transactions. Instead, we’re a digital hub—think of us as London’s friendly EV guide, minus the sales pitch. We draw inspiration from real-world efforts, like TfL’s electrification goals and the Mayor’s 2030 vision, blending them into a fictional mission that feels authentic. Our About Us page (accessible via the homepage) fleshes out this story, introducing our “team” and their drive to make London a leader in electric mobility.
                We’re committed to accessibility and trust.

        <h2>Why EcoDrive Hub Matters </h2>
        <p>London stands at a crossroads. With over 100,000 EVs registered in the UK capital by 2025 (a plausible estimate), the shift is underway, yet millions still rely on petrol or diesel. EcoDrive Hub bridges that gap, offering a platform where curiosity turns into action. We’re not just about cars—we’re about a cleaner London, from the bustling West End to the quiet suburbs. Join us, explore our pages, and let’s drive this city into a sustainable tomorrow, one electric mile at a time.        </p>
